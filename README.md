# Tamilnames
Generating tamil names using deep learning

This GitHub project contains an implementation of a Recurrent Neural 
Network (RNN) based model for generating new Tamil names. 
The model has been trained on a large dataset of Tamil names and can 
generate new, unique names based on this training data. The user can 
input a seed name, and the model will generate a new Tamil name based 
on the patterns it learned during training. The generated names are 
not just random sequences of characters, but are instead based on 
the structure and patterns present in the training data. This project 
can be useful for generating new, unique Tamil names for fictional 
characters, businesses, or for any other purposes. The code is 
implemented using PyTorch and can be easily integrated into other 
applications or further fine-tuned for specific use cases.
